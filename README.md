### Hi! :sunny:

My name is **Melissa** and it seems I am a jack of *many* unrelated trades. 
I love learning things that interest me :sparkling_heart: Because of this I am/have:

          * JavaScript BootCamp Graduate 
          * Self Taught in Java 
          * Orthodontic Assistant 
          * Licensed in Cosmetology 
          * Certified in Microblading 
          * Certified in Lash Extentions 
          * Certified in Organic Balloon Designs 

Life is just a game and I'm having so much fun experiencing each level :page_facing_up::coffee::smiley::haircut::nail_care::heart_eyes_cat::balloon:
